An image is a numpy array with the numerical values of the pixels.
A color image has pixels which are subdivided into colors RGB and another variable "ALPHA" which is the transparency of the image.
Images can be in any of these data type and it is possible for them to be converted to different data types as well:-
uint8: 0-255
uint16: 0-65535
uint32: 0-((2**32)-1)
float: 0-1 to -1-1
int8 = -128 - 127
int16 = -32768 - 32767
int32 = -2**31 - 2**31 - 1

Functions that convert images to desired dtype and properly rescale their values
img_as_float - Convert to 64-bit floating point
img_as_ubyte - Convert to 8-bit uint
img_as_uint - Convert to 16-bit uint
img_as_int - convert to 16-bit int

Important Packages for read images in python:
1. PIL (PILLOW - Image processing and manipulation fo the images) - Images are not NUMPY in this format
2. Matplotlib - for plotting (pyplot)
3. Scikit-image - Image processing, image segmentation, geometric transformation, analysis, etc.
4. OpenCV - library of programming functions (Computer Vision)
5. Propritary files to open like czifiles - 4D images example:- (1, 513, 78, 3)
6. OME-TIFF - 5D image and XML data embedded (1, 1, 3, 513, 78)
7. Glob - Read all images simultaneously
